defmodule Pulso.Loki.Push do
  @moduledoc """
  Decode a Loki `POST /loki/api/v1/push` body into a flat list of
  `Pulso.Record.Log`.

  Two wire formats land here: the JSON push, decoded in Elixir by
  `decode/1`, and the Snappy-compressed protobuf push (Alloy's default),
  decoded in Rust by `decode_protobuf/2`. Both apply the same mapping
  into `Pulso.Record.Log`, described below, so a record looks identical
  whichever path it arrived on.

  ### JSON shape

      {
        "streams": [
          {
            "stream": { "service_name": "api", "level": "info" },
            "values": [
              [ "1700000000000000000", "hello" ],
              [ "1700000000000000001", "with meta", {"trace_id": "abc", "user_id": "u1"} ]
            ]
          }
        ]
      }

  ### Protobuf shape

  Loki's `PushRequest` → `Stream` → `Entry`. Labels arrive as a
  Prometheus-style `{k="v",...}` string with Go-quoted values;
  timestamps are `google.protobuf.Timestamp`-shaped (`{seconds, nanos}`);
  structured metadata is a repeated name/value pair.

  ## Mapping to Pulso.Record.Log

    * Stream labels populate `resource` — they identify the emitter and
      are constant across the stream, the same role resource attributes
      play in OTLP.
    * `service_name` (Grafana's OTel-aligned convention) or, as a
      fallback, `service`, is lifted to `Log.service`. It stays in
      `resource` too so a `resource.service_name` query still sees it.
    * `level` (or `detected_level`) is lifted to `Log.severity_text`.
    * Structured metadata is per-record — it populates `attributes`.
    * `trace_id` / `span_id` from structured metadata are lifted to the
      dedicated struct fields and removed from `attributes`, so a
      caller querying by trace id sees them in one canonical place
      regardless of which ingest path a record came in on.

  ## Return shape

  `{records, rejected}`, mirroring `Pulso.OTLP.Logs.decode/1`. `rejected`
  counts value tuples the decoder could not interpret (missing timestamp,
  non-string line, malformed shape). A whole-stream drop (e.g. `stream`
  is not a map, or a protobuf `labels` string is malformed) is counted
  as one reject per entry in that stream — the sender should still know
  that many records did not land.

  Decode a Snappy-compressed (raw block format) protobuf `PushRequest`,
  the body Grafana Alloy and Promtail send by default.

  Decompression and decoding run in Rust (`Pulso.Ingest.NIF`). The
  uncompressed size is read from the Snappy header and checked against
  `max_decompressed_bytes` before any output buffer is allocated.

  Returns `{:ok, records, rejected}` with the same record mapping and
  reject semantics as `decode/1`, plus one addition: a record whose line
  or structured metadata is not valid UTF-8 is rejected on its own
  instead of failing the batch. Wire-level corruption fails the whole
  request.

  Every string in the returned records is a sub-binary of the
  decompressed body. Records are expected to be request-scoped; anything
  that retains them long-term should `:binary.copy/1` the fields it keeps,
  or it will pin the whole buffer.
