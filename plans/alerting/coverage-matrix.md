# Grafana rule-by-rule modeling checklist

Generated from `grafana-rule-inventory.json` by `validate_inventory.py --write-matrix`.
All 115 UIDs are included. This is a planning inventory, not a claim of implemented compatibility.
Every row still requires importer round-trip, source binding, numerical/label/error fixtures,
routing fixtures and shadow comparison before its migration status can become approved.
Source query definitions and annotation templates remain in the JSON snapshot.

`main metrics` and `main logs` identify observed Grafana sources, NOT confirmed Pulso-resident inputs.
Every selector producer/residency closure remains a migration blocker until verified; recording consumers must move with their inputs.
`synthetic` identifies externally produced probe/threshold/log inputs and is not implicitly Alloy telemetry.
`usage` requires Grafana's external usage metrics; `SQL` requires an existing external ClickHouse source.
Mixed-source rules must remain mixed-source expression graphs. `policy` means notification-tree routing;
`record` means no alert notification. Blank no-data/error settings belong to recording entries, not default alert policies.
